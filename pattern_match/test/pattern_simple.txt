While
developing
this
system,
we
needed
a
way
to
quantitatively
evaluate
the
results.
We
decided
to
build
a
test
framework
based
on
the
concept
of
Normalized
Discounted
Cumulative
Gain,
or
NDCG.
Without
getting
too
far
into
the
weeds,
this
is
a
way
to
grade
the
results
from
a
search
engine,
given
a
query,
a
set
of
results,
and
scores
for
those
results.
We
wrote
quite
a
few
test
cases
by
hand,
but
realized
that
we
needed
an
automated
way
to
generate
test
cases
for
all
settings,
including
new
settings
as
they
would
be
added,
and
settings
in
extensions.
So
we
wrote
a
tool
that
can
generate
test
cases
automatically
for
any
setting.
It
uses
words
from
the
setting
name
and
description,
and
runs
them
through
different
transformers
that
simulate
users
choosing
alternate
words,
making
typos,
or
searching
using
natural
language
patterns.
We
also
generated
test
cases
for
settings
from
some
popular
extensions
