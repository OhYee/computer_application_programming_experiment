So
we
wrote
a
tool
that
can
generate
test
cases
automatically
for
any
setting.
It
uses
words
from
the
setting
name
and
description,
and
runs
them
through
different
transformers
that
simulate
users
choosing
alternate
words,
making
typos,
or
searching
using
natural
language
patterns.
We
also
generated
test
cases
for
settings
from
some
popular
extensions
